# ☀️ AI-Powered Solar Output Predictor

🚧 **Status**: In Progress  
📅 **ETA**: July 10, 2025  
🔗 **Live App (beta)**: [Click here](https://jogaraoreddy-solar-output-predictor.streamlit.app)

---

## 🔍 Overview
This project predicts solar energy output based on weather forecasts and location using machine learning. It’s designed to assist solar energy planners, installers, and end users to estimate daily solar generation based on real-time environmental data.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 Python
- 📈 Machine Learning (LSTM / XGBoost planned)
- ☁️ OpenWeatherMap API (forecast data)
- 🌐 Streamlit (UI & deployment)
- 🗄️ Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for modeling and data prep)

---

## 🎯 Features (Coming Soon)
- [ ] User inputs location (City or PIN code)
- [ ] Real-time weather data fetched using OpenWeatherMap API
- [ ] Predicts daily solar power output (in kWh)
- [ ] Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- [ ] Deployed publicly for demo and testing
